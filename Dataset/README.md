# Initial dataset

Firstly, you need to download and unzip them: 

    sh download.sh
  
You can delete the .zip file to clear storage:

    sh delete.sh
  
Secondly, because we will be using data-loader of the Pytorch, we need to initialize the .csv file that contains the directory with the classId of every images:

    sh initial.sh
  
After waiting for a short time, the dataset is now ready to be used.
