# Traffic Sign Recognition on the GTSRB dataset

In this work, I would like to explore different architecture of the neural network in recognizing traffic signs in the GTSRB dataset. Because of the exponential growth of the deep learning in machine learning, I would like to test and experiment on different models to see and to compare their performance.

Official web page of GTSRB dataset: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news

The GTSRB consists of 43 types of traffic sign which is included inside the `Classes.txt` file.
There are 39209 pictures for the train set and xxx pictures for the test set. The total number of pictures is therefore yyy. 

More information about the dataset can be looked up at the website.

I have tried the following appraches:

    None hidden layer neural network: xxx%
    1 hidden layer neural network: xxx%
    xxx layer of CNN with yyy fully connected layer neural network: xxx%
    xxx layer of CNN with yyy fully connected layer using residual neural network: xxx%

Prerequisites

    Python OpenCV.
    PyTorch.
    Download the dataset and put the video folders into dataset/ directory, or you can cd dataset and run ./download.sh.

This was the project of myself after I learned Deep Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
