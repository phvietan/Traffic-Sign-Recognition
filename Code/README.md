# CNN, CNNAndResnet, NoneHiddenLayer, OneHiddenLayer folders

The 4 folders contain a picture that represent about their architecture.

However, only the folder `NoneHiddenLayer` describes how the codes interact, what each file is about and how to train and test the model.

# Checkpoint folder

The `checkpoint` folder contains the record of my pre-trained network. For further instruction please go to `NoneHiddenLayer`
